# One Max Problem Genetic Algorithm 

### One Max Problem
One Max Problem, also known as "the problem of the max binary vector generation", is a well-known problem in the branch of genetic algorithms.
The purpose of this algorithm is to generate a vector with every element set to 1.

## Variables
* __cloud__ is used to set the cloud environment.
* __ch__ is the channel used to communicate with the __cloud__ environment.

* __nthread__ is the thread number of the __cloud__ environment. It's used to get the result of each serverless thread.
* __individualLength__ represents the lenght of an individual.
* __dimension__ represents the number of individuals in the __population__.
* __tournamentSize__ is the number of individuals selected for the __tournamentSelection__.
* __resultSize__ represents the number of new individuals generated by the __onePointCrossover__ function.

* __parent1__ is the index of the first individual who takes part in the crossover process.
* __parent2__ is the index of the second individual who takes part in the crossover process.

* __child1__ and __child2__ are the two new individuals generated by __onePointCrossover__.

* __toMutate__ is used to set the index of the individual on which to perform the __gaussianMutation__ function.

* __indPos__ represent the index of the solution.
* __population__ is a set of individuals, represented by a matrix of __dimension__ * __individualLength__ size.
* __populationFitness__ represents the set of fitness values associated to the __population__.
* __champions__ represents the set of individuals who won the __tournamentSelection__.
* __g__ is the generations counter.
* __solutionFound__ is a boolean which indicates if the solution to the problem has been found.
